<h1>Pastry Recipe</h1>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p class="main-content">
    Blueberries<br>
    Butter<br>
    Milk<br>
    Sour Cream<br>
    Egg Whites</p>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<p class="main-content">
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350F and butter and flour three six inch pans. Sift the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar into a large bowl then whisk together and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl add the milk, sour cream, egg whites, vanilla, and butter, then whisk together. The butter should be VERY soft, you can even melt it if desired. In a small bowl toss the blueberries in a tablespoon of flour or corn starch.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet into the dry and mix until just combined. You can do this by hand or in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add the blueberries and lemon zest then fold in gently. Distribute the batter evenly into the three pans and bake for about 25-30 minutes or until the centers are springy to the touch. Invert onto a wire rack and allow to cool.</li>
        <li>While the cakes bake you can make the blueberry reduction. Add the blueberries, water, lemon juice and sugar to a pan then place over medium heat. Mash the blueberries and simmer until reduced by half. Strain into a bowl and chill.</li>
        <li>Cream the butter and salt then sift in the confectioners’ sugar in two or three batches. Beat on low and drizzle in the lemon juice. Scrape the bowl down them mix once more until uniform and</li>
        <li>Transfer about 1/2 to 3/4 a cup of the buttercream to a bowl then mix in the reduction a tablespoon at a time until the desired taste is reached.</li>
        <li>Pipe buttercream between each cake layer. I like to add alternating rings of the blueberry and lemon buttercream between each layer but make sure to pipe a thick ring of the stronger lemon buttercream at the edge. Pipe an outer layer. Scrape and smooth with an offset spatula.</li>
        <li>Add dollops using an 846 tip. Place frozen berries inside the dollop ring. You can TOTALLY use fresh blueberries but the frozen ones have a nice frost, which adds visual interest</li>
    </ol>
